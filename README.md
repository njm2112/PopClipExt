PopClip Extensions
----

This repository contains my PopClip extensions that I have made. Try them out and see what you think.

**popclipBible.popclipext** This extension will take the Bible reference in the current text sellection, look up the reference, and paste it back for the KJV and Thai KJV. It now has preferences for selecting which version to fetch and paste. The preferences can be overridden with the command key for English and the control key for Thai.

**popclipBibleFreRom.popclipext** This extension will take the Bible reference in the current text sellection, look up the reference, and paste it back for the KJV, French, and Romanian Bible. It now has preferences for selecting which version to fetch and paste. The preferences can be overridden with the command key for English, the control key for French, and the alt key for Romanian.

**suround.popclipext** This extension will suround the current selection with either "**" with no keys pressed, "##" with the command key pressed, "&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;" with the alt key pressed, or "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;" with the function key pressed.

**TSLastCleaner.popclipext** This extension will pass the selected text to TextSoap using Alfred's TextSoap workflow to perform the last stored cleaner. It then pastes it back in place.
