PopClip Extensions
----

This repository contains my PopClip extensions that I have made. Try them out and see what you think.

**popclipBible.popclipext** This extension will take the Bible reference in the current text sellection, look up the reference, and paste it back for the KJV and Thai KJV. It now has preferences for selecting which version to fetch and paste. The preferences can be overridden with<code> (command) for English and (ctrl) for Thai.</code>

**suround.popclipext** This extension will suround the current selection with either <code>"**" (none), "##" (command), "<h1></h1>" (alt-command), or "<h3></h3>" (alt)</code> depending on the modifier key you press at the same time.
